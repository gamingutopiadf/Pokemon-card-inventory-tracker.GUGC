=== DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT STRUCTURE ===
Date Added: July 21, 2025
Updated: Cleaned up duplicate testing folders

TESTING ENVIRONMENTS (FINAL STRUCTURE):

1. **Main Environment** (Original Development)
   - Location: Root folder (f:\side-projects\Pokemon-card-inventory-tracker.GUGC\)
   - Port: 3000
   - Storage Key: 'pokemonCards'
   - Purpose: Main development work
   - Access: npm start

2. **Testing Environment** (Experimental) - ACTIVE TESTING FOLDER
   - Location: testing-environment/ folder
   - Port: 3001
   - Storage Key: 'pokemonCards_testing'
   - Purpose: Experimental features and new development
   - Title: "Pokemon Card Inventory Tracker - TESTING"
   - Access: cd testing-environment && npm start
   - Status: ✅ Complete with all files (HTML, CSS, JS, README, package.json)

3. **Completed Testing** (Stable)
   - Location: completed-testing/ folder
   - Port: 3002
   - Storage Key: 'pokemonCards_completed'
   - Purpose: Stable, verified features
   - Title: "Pokemon Card Inventory Tracker - COMPLETED"
   - Access: cd completed-testing && npm start

CLEANUP NOTES:
- Removed duplicate incomplete "testing/" folder
- Using "testing-environment/" as the finished testing folder
- All environments now have complete file sets

ISOLATION FEATURES:
- Separate localStorage keys prevent data conflicts
- Different ports allow simultaneous running
- Clear environment labeling in headers
- Individual package.json files with environment-specific settings
- Separate README files with setup instructions

WORKFLOW:
1. Develop new features in testing-environment (Port 3001)
2. Test and verify in testing-environment
3. Move stable features to completed-testing (Port 3002)
4. Keep main environment (Port 3000) as primary development

CURRENT STATUS:
- All environments have Step 1 completed (Pokemon card fields + photo upload)
- Cards tab now includes dashboard stats matching Dashboard tab
- Dashboard stats update in real-time across both Dashboard and Cards tabs
- Ready for Step 2 development in testing-environment
- Safe experimentation without affecting stable versions

=== STEP 1 ENHANCEMENT COMPLETED (July 21, 2025) ===
CARDS TAB DASHBOARD STATS:
- Added three stat cards to Cards tab header:
  * Total Cards count
  * Total Value (sum of all card values)
  * Recent Additions (cards added in last 7 days)
- Stats identical to Dashboard tab for UI consistency
- Real-time synchronization between Dashboard and Cards tabs
- CSS styling matches existing dark theme design
- JavaScript updates both sets of stats simultaneously

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- HTML: Added cards-dashboard-stats section with stat-card elements
- CSS: Applied existing stat card styling to .cards-dashboard-stats
- JavaScript: Modified updateDashboard() to update both Dashboard and Cards tab stats
- Element IDs: cards-total-cards, cards-total-value, cards-recent-additions

=== IMPORTANT FILES TO PRESERVE ===
NEVER DELETE THESE CORE PROJECT FILES:
- memory.txt (this file - contains all project knowledge and preferences)
- steps.txt (contains the full development roadmap and step-by-step plan)
- ideas.txt (contains original project concepts and future feature ideas)
- README.md (project documentation)

These files contain critical project context and must be maintained throughout development.
