=== DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES ===
1. Start with Phase 1 & 2 - Get basic functionality working
2. Focus on user experience in Phase 3
3. Add data richness in Phase 4
4. Enhance with advanced features in Phase 5+

=== CURRENT TECH STACK DECISION ===
Based on "made with JavaScript" note:
- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript (Phase 1-3), consider React later
- Backend: Node.js (when cloud features needed)
- Database: localStorage → IndexedDB → Cloud database
- Styling: CSS3 with CSS Grid/Flexbox

=== QUICK START RECOMMENDATION ===
Begin with:
1. Basic HTML structure with tabs
2. Simple card add/display functionality
3. Dark theme styling
4. Local storage for data persistence

=== NOTES ===
- Test each phase thoroughly before moving to next
- Keep user feedback in mind throughout development
- Document code and decisions for future reference
- Consider creating a simple demo/prototype first
